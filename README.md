# Python-TSP
Another TSP, but this time using real cities and real direction to get to those cities

For this project I used the google maps API

Files also inclue results with the path suggested and direction, direction can be given by either walk, transit or drive

The cities that have been used are from wikipedia, then the data is cleaned, and the user inputs population amount that they would like to visit and the means of transport
